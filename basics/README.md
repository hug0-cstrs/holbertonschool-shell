# Shell, Basics

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about basics commands, navigation, files and directories in **Shell**.

# Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line (`why?`)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
* You are not allowed to use `backticks`, `&&`, `||` or `;`
* All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, weâ€™ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
